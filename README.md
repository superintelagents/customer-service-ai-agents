# Customer Service AI Agents

Build powerful customer service AI agent networks in minutes with SuperIntelAgents.ai

## Overview

This is a comprehensive demonstration of a multi-agent AI system for customer service, showcasing how developers can create complex, reliable AI agents with SuperIntelAgents.ai in minutes and iterate in seconds with proper logging and debugging.

## Features

- **5 Specialized AI Agents**: Knowledge Base, Ticket Management, Escalation, File Processing, and Integration agents
- **Single API Endpoint**: Simple `handle-request` endpoint that orchestrates all agent interactions  
- **Real-time Processing**: Live demonstration of agent coordination and task execution
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full activity logs and debugging with stack traces
- **Instant Iteration**: Make changes and see results in seconds

## Benefits of SuperIntelAgents.ai

- ⚡ **Build Complex Agents in Minutes**: No coding required - visual agent builder
- 🔄 **Iterate in Seconds**: Real-time updates and instant deployment  
- 🐛 **Proper Debugging**: Complete logging and stack trace visibility
- 🌐 **Powerful Capabilities**: API calls, compute operations, file storage, data persistence
- 🎯 **Single Endpoint**: One API call handles all agent orchestration

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## How It Works

The system uses a **General Intelligence Agent** as an orchestrator that:

1. Analyzes incoming customer requests
2. Routes to appropriate specialized agents
3. Coordinates multi-agent responses  
4. Returns unified results through a single endpoint

Each specialized agent has powerful capabilities including API calls, data storage, compute operations, and workflow automation.

## Try the Demo
